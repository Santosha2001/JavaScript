Variables: 
JS is the dynamicaly typed lanugagr means, no need to specify the type of data that variable contain.

To declare  a variable there are three ways
1. var      2. let      3. const
using these we can declare and initialize the variable.

We can reassign value to the variables. But in case of const we can't reassign the value to variable.
